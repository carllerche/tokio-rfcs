# Tokio RFCs

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the Rust community.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent
and controlled path for new features to enter the Tokio set of libraries, so
that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction the library is
evolving in.
